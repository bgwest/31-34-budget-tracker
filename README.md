# 31: Budget Tracker

## Overview

A simple expense/budget React SPA (Single Page Application) with React DOM Router and Redux state manager.

#### Features

* create a new expense
* edit an expense
* delete an expense
* prompted to re-balance if you exceed budget
* prompted to re-enter a number if expense amount is NaN

### How To

##### Start react app and refresh actively

```
npm run watch
```

### Notes

Please note:

* This is a basic concept utilizing Redux to manage state. There is nothing "pretty" about this site, yet.
* Budget amount is hardcoded. Expense is the variable amount. Budget can be a form item in the future if needed.
* Dashboard is used to display all of the components and state.
* simple css given should take care of most window sizes.
